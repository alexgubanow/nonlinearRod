abstract = {With increasing computer power simulation methods addressing discrete problems in a broad range of scientific fields become more and more available. The discrete element method is one of these discontinuous approaches used for modeling granular assemblies. Within this method the dynamics of a system of particles is modeled by tracking the motion of individual particles and their interaction with their adjacencies over time. For the interaction of particles, force models need to be specified. The resulting equations of motion are of coupled ordinary differential configuration, which are usually solved by explicit numerical schemes. In large-scale systems like avalanches, planetary rings, hoppers or chemical reactors vast numbers of particles need to be addressed. Therefore, integration schemes need to be accurate on the one hand, but also numerically efficient on the other hand. This numerical efficiency is characterized by the method's demand for memory and CPU-time. In this paper a number of mostly explicit numerical integration schemes are reviewed and applied to the benchmark problem of a particle impacting a fixed wall as investigated experimentally by Gorham and Kharaz [Gorham, D. A., {\&} Kharaz, A. H. (2000). The measurement of particle rebound characteristics. Powder Technology, 112(3), 193-202]. The accurate modeling which includes the correct integration of the equations of motion is essential. In discrete simulation methods the accuracy of properties on the single particle level directly influence the global properties of the granular assembly like velocity distributions, porosities or flow rates, whereas their correct knowledge is often of key interest in engineering applications. The impact experiment is modeled with simple force displacement approaches which allow an analytical solution of the problem. Aspects discussed are the dependency of the step size on the accuracy of certain collision properties and the related computing time. The effect of a fixed time step is analyzed. Guidelines for the efficient selection of an integration scheme considering the additional computational cost by contact detection and force calculation are presented. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {In single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a varying-focal-length cone-beam collimator can be used to reduce the truncation problem and to maintain sensitivity when imaging the organ of interest. The collimator is constructed so that the collimator holes focus to a circular symmetric, spatially varying, focal point function. The focal length increases radially from the shortest focal length at the centre to the longest focal length at the periphery of the collimator. This paper describes a 3D backprojection-filtering (BF) algorithm for this varying-focal-length cone-beam geometry. The proposed algorithm is compared to an iterative ML-EM (maximum likelihood-expectation maximization) algorithm. The 3D Hoffman brain phantom and Defrise phantom are used in computer simulations. Since the maximum tilt angle of the projection rays is small for most realistic imaging geometries, the proposed algorithm provides a good approximation. When a circular orbit is used, the BF algorithm gives an exact reconstruction of the central slice.},

abstract = {The renogram, defined as the time-activity curve obtained from measurements with a gamma detector over the kidneys after a prior injection of a radioactive tracer, can be quantified using the deconvolution method. Essentially all the inherent information in the renogram, the estimated relative renal intake function and transit time spectrum through the kidney, can be derived from the computed renal retention function. This study shows how statistical and physiological noise and different backgrounds affect the accuracy of the derived parameters. Confidence intervals for the estimated relative renal function and mean transit time (MTT) are presented. The principal source of error in relative renal function was due to extrarenal background. It was found that the error in mean transit time due to statistical noise was proportional to MTT, that the presence of extrarenal background strongly affected the accuracy of the MTT, whereas the vascular background in the renogram was of minor importance. Physiological noise, interpreted as periodic changes in transit times does, strictly speaking, invalidate the deconvolution principle, but it was possible to calculate a valid mean value of the different actual transit times.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional reconstruction method for simultaneous compensation of attenuation, scatter and distance-dependent detector response for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is described and tested by experimental studies. The method determines the attenuation factors recursively along each projection ray starting at the intersected source voxel closest to the detector. The method subtracts the scatter energy window data from the primary energy window data for scatter compensation. The detector response is modelled to be spatially invariant at a constant distance from the detector. The method convolves source distribution with the modelled response function to compensate for the detector response. The Poisson noise is modelled by Poisson likelihood and smoothed by use of a non-uniform entropy prior to searching for the maximum a posteriori probability solution. The method was tested using projections acquired from a chest phantom by a three-headed detector system with parallel hole collimators. An improvement was shown in image noise, recognition of object sizes and shapes, and quantification of concentration ratios.},

abstract = {The classical truss bar element formulation is revisited by assuming that the bar elements can support elastic strain gradients along their length. The stress-strain relation for the bars is assumed to obey the gradient elasticity theory as proposed by the third author and used extensively in recent years to interpret size effects and eliminate singularities from dislocation lines and crack tips. Instead of an algebraic equation (1D classical elasticity stress-strain relation), a differential equation governs the response of the elastic bar element and extra boundary conditions are required at the nodes. Since the corresponding displacement field may present discontinuities when conventional shape functions are employed, we overcome this difficulty by deriving the associated stiffness matrix directly from the governing differential equation of the gradient elastic bar element. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the approach. {\textcopyright} 2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.},

Applicable to many materials, the main objective of this analysis was to develop a model specifically for ice dynamics. A realistic model of glacial ice must include elasticity, brittle fracture and slow viscous deformations. Here the model is described in detail and tested with several benchmark simulations. The model was used to simulate various ice-specific applications with resulting flow rates that were compatible with Glen's law, and produced under fragmentation fragment-size distributions that agreed with the known analytical and experimental results.},

abstract = {A 3D physical model for iterative reconstruction in SPECT. has been developed and applied to experimental data. The model incorporates nonuniform attenuation using reconstructed transmission CT data and distance-dependent detector response based on response function measurements over a range of distances from the detector. The 3D model has been implemented in a computationally efficient manner with practical memory requirements. The features of the model that provide efficiency are described including a new region-dependent reconstruction (RDR) technique. With RDR, filtered backprojection is used to reconstruct areas of the image of minimal clinical importance, and the result is used to supplement the iterative reconstruction of the clinically important areas of the image. The 3D model was incorporated into the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction algorithm and tested in three phantom studies - a point source, a uniform cylinder, and an anthropomorphic thorax - and a patient 99 Tc m sestamibi study. Reconstructed images with the 3D method exhibited excellent noise and resolution characteristics. With the sestamibi data, the RDR technique produced essentially the conventional ML-EM estimate in the cardiac region with substantial time savings.},
