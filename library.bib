abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify a numerical method to simulate motion of a packed or fluidized bed of fuel particles in combustion chambers, such as a grate furnace and a rotary kiln. Therefore, the various numerical methods applied in the areas of granular matter and molecular dynamics were reviewed extensively. As a result, a time driven approach was found to be suited for the numerical simulation of particle motion in combustion chambers. Furthermore, this method can also be employed to moving boundaries which are required for the present application e.g. travelling grate. The method works in a Lagrangian frame of reference, which uses the position and orientation of particles as independent variables. These are obtained by time integration of the three-dimensional dynamics equations derived from the classical Newtonian approach for each particle. This includes the keeping track of all forces and momentums acting on each particle at every time step. Viscoelastic contact forces include normal and tangential components with viscoelastic models for energy dissipation and friction. The particle shapes are approximated by spheres and ellipsoids with a varying size and ratio of the semi-axis accounting for the variety of particle geometries in a combustion chamber. For these shapes the overlap of particles during contact is expressed by a polynomial of 4th order in the two-dimensional case and a polynomial of 6th order in the three-dimensional case. A new algorithm to detect two-dimensional elliptical particle contact with sufficient accuracy was developed. It is based on a sequence of coordinate transformations and has demonstrated its reliability in numerous applications. Finally, the method was applied to simulate the motion of spherical and elliptical particles in a rectangular enclosure, on a travelling grate, and in a rotary kiln.},

abstract = {We present and analyze different implementations of mass-spring systems for interactive simulation of deformable surfaces on graphics processing units (GPUs). For the amount of springs we target, numerical time integration of spring displacements needs to be accelerated and the transfer of displaced point positions for rendering must be avoided. To fulfill these requirements, we exploit features of recent graphics accelerators to simulate spring elongation and compression on the GPU, saving displaced point masses in graphics memory, and then sending these positions through the GPU again to render the deformed surface. Two different simulation algorithms implementing scattering and gathering operations on the GPU are compared with respect to performance and numerical accuracy. We discuss GPU specific issues to be considered in simulation techniques showing similar computation and memory access patterns to mass-spring systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {In single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), a varying-focal-length cone-beam collimator can be used to reduce the truncation problem and to maintain sensitivity when imaging the organ of interest. The collimator is constructed so that the collimator holes focus to a circular symmetric, spatially varying, focal point function. The focal length increases radially from the shortest focal length at the centre to the longest focal length at the periphery of the collimator. This paper describes a 3D backprojection-filtering (BF) algorithm for this varying-focal-length cone-beam geometry. The proposed algorithm is compared to an iterative ML-EM (maximum likelihood-expectation maximization) algorithm. The 3D Hoffman brain phantom and Defrise phantom are used in computer simulations. Since the maximum tilt angle of the projection rays is small for most realistic imaging geometries, the proposed algorithm provides a good approximation. When a circular orbit is used, the BF algorithm gives an exact reconstruction of the central slice.},

abstract = {The paper deals with topology optimiza- tion of structures undergoing large deformations. The geometrically nonlinear behaviour of the structures are modelled using a total Lagrangian finite element for- mulation and the equilibrium is found using a Newton- Raphson iterative scheme. The sensitivities of the ob- jective functions are found with the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. A filtering scheme is used to obtain checkerboard-free and mesh-independent designs and a continuation approach improves convergence to efficient designs. Different objective functions are tested. Minimizing compliance for a fixed load results in degenerated topol- ogies which are very inefficient for smaller or larger loads. The problem of obtaining degenerated “optimal” topol- ogies which only can support the design load is evenmore pronounced than for structures with linear response. The problem is circumvented by optimizing the structures for multiple loading conditions or by minimizing the com- plementary elastic work. Examples show that differences in stiffnesses of structures optimized using linear and nonlinear modelling are generally small but they can be large in certain cases involving buckling or snap-through effects},

The method determines the attenuation factors recursively along each projection ray starting at the intersected source voxel closest to the detector. The method subtracts the scatter energy window data from the primary energy window data for scatter compensation. The detector response is modelled to be spatially invariant at a constant distance from the detector. The method convolves source distribution with the modelled response function to compensate for the detector response. The Poisson noise is modelled by Poisson likelihood and smoothed by use of a non-uniform entropy prior to searching for the maximum a posteriori probability solution. The method was tested using projections acquired from a chest phantom by a three-headed detector system with parallel hole collimators. An improvement was shown in image noise, recognition of object sizes and shapes, and quantification of concentration ratios.},

The given models predict a variety of mechanical behaviors in the regime of large displacements, including an extreme stiffening-type response, already known in the literature, and a newly discovered, extreme softening behavior. The latter may lead to a snap buckling event producing an axial collapse of the structure. The switching from one mechanical regime to another depends on the aspect ratio of the structure, the magnitude of the applied prestress, and the material properties of the constituent elements. We discuss potential mechanical and acoustic applications of such behaviors, which are related to the design and manufacture of tensegrity lattices and innovative metamaterials.},

@article{Kruggel-Emden2008,
abstract = {With increasing computer power simulation methods addressing discrete problems in a broad range of scientific fields become more and more available. The discrete element method is one of these discontinuous approaches used for modeling granular assemblies. Within this method the dynamics of a system of particles is modeled by tracking the motion of individual particles and their interaction with their adjacencies over time. For the interaction of particles, force models need to be specified. The resulting equations of motion are of coupled ordinary differential configuration, which are usually solved by explicit numerical schemes. In large-scale systems like avalanches, planetary rings, hoppers or chemical reactors vast numbers of particles need to be addressed. Therefore, integration schemes need to be accurate on the one hand, but also numerically efficient on the other hand. This numerical efficiency is characterized by the method's demand for memory and CPU-time. In this paper a number of mostly explicit numerical integration schemes are reviewed and applied to the benchmark problem of a particle impacting a fixed wall as investigated experimentally by Gorham and Kharaz [Gorham, D. A., {\&} Kharaz, A. H. (2000). The measurement of particle rebound characteristics. Powder Technology, 112(3), 193-202]. The accurate modeling which includes the correct integration of the equations of motion is essential. In discrete simulation methods the accuracy of properties on the single particle level directly influence the global properties of the granular assembly like velocity distributions, porosities or flow rates, whereas their correct knowledge is often of key interest in engineering applications. The impact experiment is modeled with simple force displacement approaches which allow an analytical solution of the problem. Aspects discussed are the dependency of the step size on the accuracy of certain collision properties and the related computing time. The effect of a fixed time step is analyzed. Guidelines for the efficient selection of an integration scheme considering the additional computational cost by contact detection and force calculation are presented. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The training system helps surgeon trainees to acquire, practice and evaluate their surgical skills, and the key component of such a system is to simulate the dynamic procedure such as 3D biological tissue deformation in surgical operation. In our paper, an improved mass-spring model is proposed to represent the biological tissue surface, during which the virtual spring is introduced and utilized to help compensate the weakness of the conventional mass-spring model. Then Verlet integration is adopted to calculate the position of mass points during the deformation process without explicit computation of the velocity values. Finally the bilinear interpolation method is employed to generate one smooth mesh to render the deformed tissue surface. To speed up the simulation performance for surgical tissue deformation, CUDA based GPU computing is adopted, while related data structures and algorithm are designed and implemented for the parallel computation. Our proposed method has been tested by experiments and it has the ability to generate realistic biological tissue deformation images in real time.},

A co-rotational formulation combined with small deflection beam theory with the inclusion of the effect of axial force is adopted. A body attached coordinate is used to distinguish between rigid body and deformational rotations. The deformational nodal rotational angles are assumed to be small, and the membrane strain along the deformed beam axis obtained from the elongation of the arc length of the deformed beam element is assumed to be constant. The element internal nodal forces are calculated using the total deformational nodal rotations in the body attached coordinate. The element stiffness matrix is obtained by superimposing the bending and the geometric stiffness matrices of the elementary beam element and the stiffness matrix of the linear bar element. An incremental iterative method based on the Newton-Raphson method combined with a constant arc length control method is employed for the solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations. In order to improve convergence properties of the equilibrium iteration, a two-cycle iteration scheme is introduced.

The stress-strain relation for the bars is assumed to obey the gradient elasticity theory as proposed by the third author and used extensively in recent years to interpret size effects and eliminate singularities from dislocation lines and crack tips. Instead of an algebraic equation (1D classical elasticity stress-strain relation), a differential equation governs the response of the elastic bar element and extra boundary conditions are required at the nodes. Since the corresponding displacement field may present discontinuities when conventional shape functions are employed, we overcome this difficulty by deriving the associated stiffness matrix directly from the governing differential equation of the gradient elastic bar element.

abstract = {This work presents a fully nonlinear geometrically-exact multi-parameter rod model that incorporates general in-plane cross-sectional changes as well as general out-of-plane cross- sectional warping. The formulation constitutes an extension of the earlier works, in the sense that the restrictions to a rigid cross-section and to a Saint-Venant-like elastic warping are now removed from the theory. The definition of energetically conjugated cross-sectional resultants in terms of generalized stresses and strains, based on the concept of a cross-section director, simplifies the derivation of equilibrium equations and the enforcement of boundary conditions, in either weak or strong senses. In addition, the corresponding tangent bilinear weak form is obtained in a more expedient way, rendering always symmetric for hyper-elastic materials and conservative loadings. The definition of a cross-section director allows also the introduction of independent degrees-of-freedom to describe both the in-plane cross-sectional changes and the out-of-plane warping. Fully three-dimensional finite strain constitutive equations can therefore be employed with no spurious stiffening. Finite rotations are treated consistently by the Euler-Rodrigues formula in a pure Lagrangean framework. Altogether, the present assumptions allow a consistent basis for the proper representation of profile (distortional) deformations, which are typical of cold-formed thin-walled rod structures. This is one of the main features of the formulation, as the use of more complex shell models in order to capture such phenomena can be needless.},

In the present work, the choice of the position of the rod reference line is discussed. This choice plays an important role in the overall behavior because of the large changes of the cross-section shape. We show that the model published in Guinot et al.

abstract = {Since the advent of programmable graphics processors(GPUs) their computational powers have been utilized for general purpose computation. Initially by “exploiting” graphics APIs and recently through dedicated parallel computation frameworks such as the Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) from Nvidia. This paper investigates multiple implementations of volumetric Mass-Spring-Damper systems inCUDA. The obtained performance is compared to previous implementations utilizing the GPU through the OpenGL graphics API.We find that both performance and optimization strategies differ widely between the OpenGL andCUDAimplementations. Specifically, the previous recommendation of using implicitly connected particles is replaced by a recommendation that supports unstructured meshes and run-time topological changes with an insignificant performance reduction.},

abstract = {The renogram, defined as the time-activity curve obtained from measurements with a gamma detector over the kidneys after a prior injection of a radioactive tracer, can be quantified using the deconvolution method. Essentially all the inherent information in the renogram, the estimated relative renal intake function and transit time spectrum through the kidney, can be derived from the computed renal retention function. This study shows how statistical and physiological noise and different backgrounds affect the accuracy of the derived parameters. Confidence intervals for the estimated relative renal function and mean transit time (MTT) are presented. The principal source of error in relative renal function was due to extrarenal background. It was found that the error in mean transit time due to statistical noise was proportional to MTT, that the presence of extrarenal background strongly affected the accuracy of the MTT, whereas the vascular background in the renogram was of minor importance. Physiological noise, interpreted as periodic changes in transit times does, strictly speaking, invalidate the deconvolution principle, but it was possible to calculate a valid mean value of the different actual transit times.},

@article{Guinot2012,
abstract = {This paper is focused on the modeling of rod-like elastic bodies that have an initially curved and thin-walled cross-section and that undergo important localized changes of the cross-section shape. The typical example is the folding of a carpenter's tape measure for which the folds are caused by the flattening of the cross-section in some localized areas. In this context, we propose a planar rod model that accounts for large displacements and large rotations in dynamics. Starting from a classical shell model, the main additional assumption consists in introducing an elastica kinematics to describe the large changes of the cross-section shape with very few parameters. The expressions of the strain and kinetic energies are derived by performing an analytical integration over the section. The Hamilton principle is directly introduced in a suitable finite element software to solve the problem. The folding, coiling and deployment of a tape spring is studied to demonstrate the ability of the model to account for several phenomena: creation of a single fold and associated snap-through behavior, splitting of a fold into two, motion of a fold along the tape during a dynamic deployment, scenarios of coiling and uncoiling of a bistable tape spring. This 1D model may also be relevant for future applications in biomechanics, biophysics and nanomechanics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {A 3D physical model for iterative reconstruction in SPECT. has been developed and applied to experimental data. The model incorporates nonuniform attenuation using reconstructed transmission CT data and distance-dependent detector response based on response function measurements over a range of distances from the detector. The 3D model has been implemented in a computationally efficient manner with practical memory requirements. The features of the model that provide efficiency are described including a new region-dependent reconstruction (RDR) technique. With RDR, filtered backprojection is used to reconstruct areas of the image of minimal clinical importance, and the result is used to supplement the iterative reconstruction of the clinically important areas of the image. The 3D model was incorporated into the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction algorithm and tested in three phantom studies - a point source, a uniform cylinder, and an anthropomorphic thorax - and a patient 99 Tc m sestamibi study. Reconstructed images with the 3D method exhibited excellent noise and resolution characteristics. With the sestamibi data, the RDR technique produced essentially the conventional ML-EM estimate in the cardiac region with substantial time savings.},
