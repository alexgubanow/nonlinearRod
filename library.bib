abstract = {A deeper understanding of the milling operation of ball mills helps mineral processing engineers to control and optimize them, and therefore, reduce their consuming power. In this work, the milling operation of ball mills is investigated using two methods, i.e. DEM and combined DEM-SPH. First, a pilot scale ball mill with no lifter is simulated by both methods. Then another pilot scale ball mill with eight rectangle lifters is simulated again by both methods. The effects of lifters on ball shoulder and toe points as well as on creation of cascading and cataracting movements for balls are studied by both methods. At the present time, there is not enough measured data available for dense slurries interacting with the coarse particulates available in the public domain that can be used adequately to validate these types of predictions. The results obtained indicated that fluid slurry in the mill lowered the charge shoulder by about 28 cm and 25 cm in the no-lifter and eight-lifter cases, respectively. However, it raised the charge toe by about 36 cm and 6 cm in the no-lifter and eight-lifter cases, respectively},

abstract = {A 3D physical model for iterative reconstruction in SPECT. has been developed and applied to experimental data. The model incorporates nonuniform attenuation using reconstructed transmission CT data and distance-dependent detector response based on response function measurements over a range of distances from the detector. The 3D model has been implemented in a computationally efficient manner with practical memory requirements. The features of the model that provide efficiency are described including a new region-dependent reconstruction (RDR) technique. With RDR, filtered backprojection is used to reconstruct areas of the image of minimal clinical importance, and the result is used to supplement the iterative reconstruction of the clinically important areas of the image. The 3D model was incorporated into the maximum likelihood-expectation maximization (ML-EM) reconstruction algorithm and tested in three phantom studies - a point source, a uniform cylinder, and an anthropomorphic thorax - and a patient 99 Tc m sestamibi study. Reconstructed images with the 3D method exhibited excellent noise and resolution characteristics. With the sestamibi data, the RDR technique produced essentially the conventional ML-EM estimate in the cardiac region with substantial time savings.},

abstract = {Vibrating screens are critical machines used for size classification in mineral processing. Their proper operation, including accurate vibration movement and slope angle, can provide the benefits of energy savings and cost reductions in the screening process and the whole mining process. Dynamic models of the vibrating screen movement available in the literature do not simulate ore motion or its interaction with screen decks. The discrete element method (DEM) allows for the calculation of the dynamic of the ore. In this paper, two 2D three-degrees-of-freedom dynamic models for a vibrating screen are tested, using linear and nonlinear approaches for angular displacement. These models consider the inertia of the ore and the ore force calculated with DEM. A double-deck linear motion vibrating screen is simulated using the DEM software LIGGGTHS. DEM is used to obtain the ore parameters in the steady state and the force on the screen decks. Two cases are compared: Case 1 considers the ore as moving together with the vibrating screen, and Case 2 considers the ore force on the screen deck as calculated by DEM. Simulations are carried out with data for an industrial vibrating screen used in copper mining. The force over the screen is significantly different between the cases. Case 1 produces a force that is unrealistic because the ore cannot produce a high-amplitude adhesion force over the screen decks. In Case 2, no adhesion force acts between the ore and deck. It is concluded that the linear dynamic model used in Case 2 is adequate to evaluate the influence of the ore on the movement of the vibrating screen. The linear dynamic model considering the force as in Case 1 can be used to simulate a vibrating screen, as long as a correct calibration parameter is included to obtain an accurate motion amplitude.},

abstract = {From its inception, the combined finite discrete element method has used a distributed potential contact force algorithm to resolve interaction between finite elements. The contact interaction algorithm relies on evaluation of the contact force potential field. The problem with existing algorithms is that the potential field introduces artificial numerical non-smoothness in the contact force. This work introduces a smooth potential field based on the finite element topology, and a generalized contact interaction law is constructed on top of the smooth potential field. A number of validation cases for the proposed algorithm, considering different shapes of discrete elements, are presented, and detailed aspects of the proposed contact interaction law are tested with numerical examples.},

abstract = {The renogram, defined as the time-activity curve obtained from measurements with a gamma detector over the kidneys after a prior injection of a radioactive tracer, can be quantified using the deconvolution method. Essentially all the inherent information in the renogram, the estimated relative renal intake function and transit time spectrum through the kidney, can be derived from the computed renal retention function. This study shows how statistical and physiological noise and different backgrounds affect the accuracy of the derived parameters. Confidence intervals for the estimated relative renal function and mean transit time (MTT) are presented. The principal source of error in relative renal function was due to extrarenal background. It was found that the error in mean transit time due to statistical noise was proportional to MTT, that the presence of extrarenal background strongly affected the accuracy of the MTT, whereas the vascular background in the renogram was of minor importance. Physiological noise, interpreted as periodic changes in transit times does, strictly speaking, invalidate the deconvolution principle, but it was possible to calculate a valid mean value of the different actual transit times.},

abstract = {The objective of this paper is to identify a numerical method to simulate motion of a packed or fluidized bed of fuel particles in combustion chambers, such as a grate furnace and a rotary kiln. Therefore, the various numerical methods applied in the areas of granular matter and molecular dynamics were reviewed extensively. As a result, a time driven approach was found to be suited for the numerical simulation of particle motion in combustion chambers. Furthermore, this method can also be employed to moving boundaries which are required for the present application e.g. travelling grate. The method works in a Lagrangian frame of reference, which uses the position and orientation of particles as independent variables. These are obtained by time integration of the three-dimensional dynamics equations derived from the classical Newtonian approach for each particle. This includes the keeping track of all forces and momentums acting on each particle at every time step. Viscoelastic contact forces include normal and tangential components with viscoelastic models for energy dissipation and friction. The particle shapes are approximated by spheres and ellipsoids with a varying size and ratio of the semi-axis accounting for the variety of particle geometries in a combustion chamber. For these shapes the overlap of particles during contact is expressed by a polynomial of 4th order in the two-dimensional case and a polynomial of 6th order in the three-dimensional case. A new algorithm to detect two-dimensional elliptical particle contact with sufficient accuracy was developed. It is based on a sequence of coordinate transformations and has demonstrated its reliability in numerous applications. Finally, the method was applied to simulate the motion of spherical and elliptical particles in a rectangular enclosure, on a travelling grate, and in a rotary kiln.},

abstract = {A three-dimensional reconstruction method for simultaneous compensation of attenuation, scatter and distance-dependent detector response for single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) is described and tested by experimental studies. The method determines the attenuation factors recursively along each projection ray starting at the intersected source voxel closest to the detector. The method subtracts the scatter energy window data from the primary energy window data for scatter compensation. The detector response is modelled to be spatially invariant at a constant distance from the detector. The method convolves source distribution with the modelled response function to compensate for the detector response. The Poisson noise is modelled by Poisson likelihood and smoothed by use of a non-uniform entropy prior to searching for the maximum a posteriori probability solution. The method was tested using projections acquired from a chest phantom by a three-headed detector system with parallel hole collimators. An improvement was shown in image noise, recognition of object sizes and shapes, and quantification of concentration ratios.},

abstract = {The classical truss bar element formulation is revisited by assuming that the bar elements can support elastic strain gradients along their length. The stress-strain relation for the bars is assumed to obey the gradient elasticity theory as proposed by the third author and used extensively in recent years to interpret size effects and eliminate singularities from dislocation lines and crack tips. Instead of an algebraic equation (1D classical elasticity stress-strain relation), a differential equation governs the response of the elastic bar element and extra boundary conditions are required at the nodes. Since the corresponding displacement field may present discontinuities when conventional shape functions are employed, we overcome this difficulty by deriving the associated stiffness matrix directly from the governing differential equation of the gradient elastic bar element. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the approach. {\textcopyright}2012 Praise Worthy Prize S.r.l.},

This paper presents the adaptation of a semi-implicit time integration scheme that has been reported in the literature and its implementation for use in discrete element methods (DEM). The computational efficiency of DEM methods is primarily associated with the selection of time increment sizes, as dictated by stability requirements, and other factors that depend on the particulars of the DEM implementation and the problems solved. The proposed time integration scheme and the associated DEM are developed for problems pertaining to rigid-particle interaction and interaction of elastic bodies that are modeled as a cluster of rigid interconnected particles. Verification studies that consider nonlinear problems demonstrate that the proposed algorithm is unconditionally stable and accurate even for large time step sizes and when applicable does not require any inversions of the system matrices. Assessment studies on the accuracy, stability, and computational efficiency of the method have been conducted and discussed. The implementation of the proposed method is discussed and demonstrated through a showcase problem.},

The geometrically nonlinear behaviour of the structures are modelled using a total Lagrangian finite element for- mulation and the equilibrium is found using a Newton- Raphson iterative scheme. The sensitivities of the ob- jective functions are found with the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. A filtering scheme is used to obtain checkerboard-free and mesh-independent designs and a continuation approach improves convergence to efficient designs. Different objective functions are tested. Minimizing compliance for a fixed load results in degenerated topol- ogies which are very inefficient for smaller or larger loads. The problem of obtaining degenerated “optimal” topol- ogies which only can support the design load is evenmore pronounced than for structures with linear response. The problem is circumvented by optimizing the structures for multiple loading conditions or by minimizing the com- plementary elastic work. Examples show that differences in stiffnesses of structures optimized using linear and nonlinear modelling are generally small but they can be large in certain cases involving buckling or snap-through effects},

By investigating the characteristics of both the non-linear elastic and the non-linear damped Hertzian contact models, it has been found that higher orders of accuracy are recoverable and depends on the degree of the governing non-linear equation.

A co-rotational formulation combined with small deflection beam theory with the inclusion of the effect of axial force is adopted. A body attached coordinate is used to distinguish between rigid body and deformational rotations. The deformational nodal rotational angles are assumed to be small, and the membrane strain along the deformed beam axis obtained from the elongation of the arc length of the deformed beam element is assumed to be constant. The element internal nodal forces are calculated using the total deformational nodal rotations in the body attached coordinate. The element stiffness matrix is obtained by superimposing the bending and the geometric stiffness matrices of the elementary beam element and the stiffness matrix of the linear bar element. An incremental iterative method based on the Newton-Raphson method combined with a constant arc length control method is employed for the solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations. In order to improve convergence properties of the equilibrium iteration, a two-cycle iteration scheme is introduced. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

abstract = {Contact dynamics (CD) is a powerful method to solve the dynamics of large systems of colliding rigid bodies. CD can be computationally more efficient than classical penalty-based discrete element methods (DEM) for simulating contact between stiff materials such as rock, glass, or engineering metals. However, by idealizing bodies as perfectly rigid, contact forces computed by CD can be non-unique due to indeterminacy in the contact network, which is a common occurence in dense granular flows. We propose a frictionless CD method that is designed to identify only the unique set of contact forces that would be predicted by a soft particle method, such as DEM, in the limit of large stiffness. The method involves applying an elastic compatibility condition to the contact forces, which maintains no-penetration constraints but filters out force distributions that could not have arisen from stiff elastic contacts. The method can be used as a post-processing step that could be integrated into existing CD codes with minimal effort. We demonstrate its efficacy in a variety of indeterminate problems, including some involving multiple materials, non-spherical shapes, and nonlinear contact constitutive laws.},

abstract = {The mechanical behavior of the heart is guided by the propagation of an electrical wave, called action potential. Many diseases have multiple effects on both electrical and mechanical cardiac physiology. To support a better understanding of the multiscale and multiphysics processes involved in physiological and pathological cardiac conditions, a lot of work has been done in developing computational tools to simulate the electro-mechanical behavior of the heart. In this work, we propose a new user-friendly and efficient tool for the electro-mechanical simulation of the cardiac tissue that is based on cellular automata and mass-spring models. The proposed tool offers a user-friendly interface that allows one to interact with the simulation on-the-fly. In addition, the simulator is parallelized with CUDA and OpenMP to further speedup the execution time of the simulations. {\textcopyright} 2012 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

abstract = {We study the geometrically nonlinear behavior of uniformly compressed tensegrity prisms through fully elastic and rigid-elastic models. The given models predict a variety of mechanical behaviors in the regime of large displacements, including an extreme stiffening-type response, already known in the literature, and a newly discovered, extreme softening behavior. The latter may lead to a snap buckling event producing an axial collapse of the structure. The switching from one mechanical regime to another depends on the aspect ratio of the structure, the magnitude of the applied prestress, and the material properties of the constituent elements. We discuss potential mechanical and acoustic applications of such behaviors, which are related to the design and manufacture of tensegrity lattices and innovative metamaterials.},

@article{Guinot2012,
abstract = {This paper is focused on the modeling of rod-like elastic bodies that have an initially curved and thin-walled cross-section and that undergo important localized changes of the cross-section shape. The typical example is the folding of a carpenter's tape measure for which the folds are caused by the flattening of the cross-section in some localized areas. In this context, we propose a planar rod model that accounts for large displacements and large rotations in dynamics. Starting from a classical shell model, the main additional assumption consists in introducing an elastica kinematics to describe the large changes of the cross-section shape with very few parameters. The expressions of the strain and kinetic energies are derived by performing an analytical integration over the section. The Hamilton principle is directly introduced in a suitable finite element software to solve the problem. The folding, coiling and deployment of a tape spring is studied to demonstrate the ability of the model to account for several phenomena: creation of a single fold and associated snap-through behavior, splitting of a fold into two, motion of a fold along the tape during a dynamic deployment, scenarios of coiling and uncoiling of a bistable tape spring. This 1D model may also be relevant for future applications in biomechanics, biophysics and nanomechanics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers. The discrete element method (DEM) has been widely used to study the mechanical behavior of granular materials. However, potential error accumulation over the required large number of time steps due to the explicit time integration in DEM simulations may undermine the simulation accuracy. In this paper, a computing scheme based on real-time data fusion between a sensing mechanism and traditional DEM is developed and investigated. The developed sensing mechanism and real-time (SMART) computing consists of: (1) real-time data acquisition of particle kinematics through a wireless instrumentation called SmartRocks that are embedded at discrete locations in a granular assemblage, and (2) a built-in data-fusion-based algorithm using the Kalman filter to integrate the prediction generated by DEM and the measurements reported by SmartRocks. The performance of the SMART computing algorithm is investigated by simulating a series of ball collision experiments consisting of two-ball center-to-center, two-ball off-center, and multiball collisions. It is concluded that SMART computing can improve the accuracy of DEM simulations. The results of this study suggest that the location and number of SmartRocks, whose recordings are fused into DEM simulations to recondition the particle movements, are important to the accuracy of SMART computing.},

abstract = {In this paper, we describe an industrial application of the discrete element method (DEM). The DEM has been applied to various powder systems thus far and therefore appears to be an established approach. However, it cannot be applied to many industrial systems because of several critical problems such as modeling of large-scale simulations, complexly shaped wall boundaries and free surface fluid flow. To solve these problems, novel models were developed by our group. A coarse-grain DEM model was developed for large-scale simulations, a signed distance function-based wall boundary model was developed for complexly shaped walls and a DEM-moving particle semi-implicit method was developed for solid-liquid flow involving a free surface. The adequacy of these models was demonstrated through verification and validation tests. Our approach shows promise in industrial applications.},

abstract = {This study examines the behaviour of continuous time integration schemes over discontinuities in the tangential forces typical in an oblique impact within a Discrete Element Simulation (DEM). High order schemes are associated low error and efficient computation, however, for DEM this is not always the case. The simulations consist of a particle impacting tangentially with a plane and sliding along it, this makes the numerical integration independent of errors from the normal force integration. Three possible force regimes that occur in the tangential motion of an oblique impact are explored; frictional, elastic and elastic-to-frictional. Tests are conducted to explore the effects of the location of the discontinuity within the time step and to examine scheme order through varying time step resolution. For certain scenarios the tangential motion contains elastic and then frictional forces, this presents a second discontinuity between these force regimes. The effects of this second discontinuity are also presented. It was found that all schemes were limited to 1st order by at least one of the conditions tested. The Symplectic Euler is recommended as it is found to be of generally higher accuracy than other 1st order schemes in these tests, as was found in a similar study regarding normal impacts. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Kruggel-Emden2008,
abstract = {With increasing computer power simulation methods addressing discrete problems in a broad range of scientific fields become more and more available. The discrete element method is one of these discontinuous approaches used for modeling granular assemblies. Within this method the dynamics of a system of particles is modeled by tracking the motion of individual particles and their interaction with their adjacencies over time. For the interaction of particles, force models need to be specified. The resulting equations of motion are of coupled ordinary differential configuration, which are usually solved by explicit numerical schemes. In large-scale systems like avalanches, planetary rings, hoppers or chemical reactors vast numbers of particles need to be addressed. Therefore, integration schemes need to be accurate on the one hand, but also numerically efficient on the other hand. This numerical efficiency is characterized by the method's demand for memory and CPU-time. In this paper a number of mostly explicit numerical integration schemes are reviewed and applied to the benchmark problem of a particle impacting a fixed wall as investigated experimentally by Gorham and Kharaz [Gorham, D. A., {\&} Kharaz, A. H. (2000). The measurement of particle rebound characteristics. Powder Technology, 112(3), 193-202]. The accurate modeling which includes the correct integration of the equations of motion is essential. In discrete simulation methods the accuracy of properties on the single particle level directly influence the global properties of the granular assembly like velocity distributions, porosities or flow rates, whereas their correct knowledge is often of key interest in engineering applications. The impact experiment is modeled with simple force displacement approaches which allow an analytical solution of the problem. Aspects discussed are the dependency of the step size on the accuracy of certain collision properties and the related computing time. The effect of a fixed time step is analyzed. Guidelines for the efficient selection of an integration scheme considering the additional computational cost by contact detection and force calculation are presented. {\textcopyright}2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The overall prognosis of patients with mitral valve prolapse is excellent, but a small subset will develop serious complications, including infective endocarditis, sudden cardiac death, and severe mitral regurgitation. We present a comprehensive review of mitral valve prolapse, examining normal mitral anatomy, the clinical and echocardiographic features of mitral valve prolapse, and the pathophysiology and genetics of the disorder. We discuss the contemporary management of both asymptomatic and symptomatic prolapse, with particular attention to the timing and technique of surgical repair. We conclude that echocardiography is the method of choice for diagnosing mitral valve prolapse, that clinical and echocardiographic features can predict which patients with prolapse are at highest risk for complications, and that mitral valve repair is the treatment of choice for symptomatic prolapse.},

abstract = {This work presents a fully nonlinear geometrically-exact multi-parameter rod model that incorporates general in-plane cross-sectional changes as well as general out-of-plane cross- sectional warping. The formulation constitutes an extension of the earlier works, in the sense that the restrictions to a rigid cross-section and to a Saint-Venant-like elastic warping are now removed from the theory. The definition of energetically conjugated cross-sectional resultants in terms of generalized stresses and strains, based on the concept of a cross-section director, simplifies the derivation of equilibrium equations and the enforcement of boundary conditions, in either weak or strong senses. In addition, the corresponding tangent bilinear weak form is obtained in a more expedient way, rendering always symmetric for hyper-elastic materials and conservative loadings. The definition of a cross-section director allows also the introduction of independent degrees-of-freedom to describe both the in-plane cross-sectional changes and the out-of-plane warping. Fully three-dimensional finite strain constitutive equations can therefore be employed with no spurious stiffening. Finite rotations are treated consistently by the Euler-Rodrigues formula in a pure Lagrangean framework. Altogether, the present assumptions allow a consistent basis for the proper representation of profile (distortional) deformations, which are typical of cold-formed thin-walled rod structures. This is one of the main features of the formulation, as the use of more complex shell models in order to capture such phenomena can be needless.},

The model used generated reproducible structures with good match between the predicted voidage profiles and correlations from literature. Three different loading methodologies-uniform, sock and wall were simulated by varying the initial loading positions from which the particles are introduced into the bed, with bulk voidage calculated using geometric computations and radial voidage patterns obtained by edge-based technique. Additionally, the tortuosity values were calculated for different loading strategies using the PathFinder algorithm. The bulk voidage values stabilized to 0.39 with increase in bed-particle diameter ratio. Increase in the polydispersity of the particle samples dampens the oscillations in radial voidage compared to monodisperse particle samples. Beds generated with varying loading methods demonstrated similar tortuosity values as well. For the case of polydisperse particles, particle segregation behavior varied with loading methodology employed.},

@article{Hanley2017,
abstract = {The numerical errors was used to verify the correctness of key results. The truncation errors, which are larger than the round-off errors by orders of magnitude, have a superlinear relationship with both the simulation time-step and the interparticle collision speed. This remains the case regardless of the simulation details including the chosen contact model, particle size distribution, particle density or stiffness. Hence, the total errors can usually be reduced by choosing a smaller time-step. Increasing the polydispersity in a simulation by including smaller particles necessitates choosing a smaller time-step to maintain simulation stability and reduces the truncation errors in most cases. The truncation errors are increased by the dissipation of energy by frictional sliding or by the inclusion of damping in the system. The number of contacts affects the accuracy, and one can deduce that because 2D simulations contain fewer interparticle contacts than the equivalent 3D simulations, they therefore have lower accrued simulation errors.

Despite the signature spike-bubble instability structure analogous to the hydrodynamic RM instability, the growth of the perturbation amplitude in granular media undergoes an exponential phase followed by a linear phase, markedly differing from the hydrodynamic RM instability and indicating a fundamentally different mechanism. The granular RM-like instability arises from the incipient transverse granular flows induced by hydrodynamic effects upon the shock interaction. Substantial perturbation growth is initiated by the ensuing rarefaction dilation when the hydrodynamic effects are small. It is found that the interplay between the localized transverse and radial granular flows sustains the persistent perturbation growth and drives the corresponding morphological changes in the instability pattern.},

abstract = {Discontinua simulations are becoming an important part of Computational Mechanics to the extent that Computational Mechanics of Discontinua is becoming a separate subdiscipline of Computational Mechanics. Among the most widely used methods of Computational Mechanics of Discontinua are Discrete Element Methods, Molecular Dynamics Methods, Combined Finite-Discrete Element Methods, DDA, Manifold Methods, etc. The common feature of all these methods is time discretization of the governing equations and the resulting mostly explicit time integration schemes. A wide range of time integration schemes is available in the literature. In this paper a comparative study of some of the most commonly used explicit time integration schemes is made in terms of accuracy, stability and CPU efficiency. The study has been performed using numerical experiments based on a one degree of freedom mass-spring system. The results are presented as charts that can be used when deciding which scheme to use for a particular discontinua problem. {\textcopyright} 2004 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {A discrete-element model was developed to study the behavior of viscoelastic materials that are allowed to fracture. Applicable to many materials, the main objective of this analysis was to develop a model specifically for ice dynamics. A realistic model of glacial ice must include elasticity, brittle fracture and slow viscous deformations. Here the model is described in detail and tested with several benchmark simulations. The model was used to simulate various ice-specific applications with resulting flow rates that were compatible with Glen's law, and produced under fragmentation fragment-size distributions that agreed with the known analytical and experimental results.},

@article{Picault2014,
abstract = {A planar rod model with flexible cross-section has been recently proposed in literature (Guinot et al., 2012). This model is especially suitable for the modeling of tape springs, which develop localized folds due to the flattening of the cross-section. Starting from a complete non-linear elastic shell model, original kinematics assumptions (inspired from the elastica model) have been made to describe the important in-plane changes of the cross-section shape. In the present work, the choice of the position of the rod reference line is discussed. This choice plays an important role in the overall behavior because of the large changes of the cross-section shape. We show that the model published in Guinot et al. (2012) can be improved by considering the centerline as the rod reference line. This enhanced model is then validated through quantitative comparisons with experimental results of dynamic deployments taken from literature. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The medical training systems based on virtual simulation are highly desired since minimally invasive surgical techniques have become popular to patients. The training system helps surgeon trainees to acquire, practice and evaluate their surgical skills, and the key component of such a system is to simulate the dynamic procedure such as 3D biological tissue deformation in surgical operation. In our paper, an improved mass-spring model is proposed to represent the biological tissue surface, during which the virtual spring is introduced and utilized to help compensate the weakness of the conventional mass-spring model. Then Verlet integration is adopted to calculate the position of mass points during the deformation process without explicit computation of the velocity values. Finally the bilinear interpolation method is employed to generate one smooth mesh to render the deformed tissue surface. To speed up the simulation performance for surgical tissue deformation, CUDA based GPU computing is adopted, while related data structures and algorithm are designed and implemented for the parallel computation. Our proposed method has been tested by experiments and it has the ability to generate realistic biological tissue deformation images in real time.},

abstract = {A combined viscoelastic/sintering model is incorporated in a sintering study of a ZrB2-SiC composite using the discrete element method. The sintering component of interacting particle forces arises from grain boundary and surface diffusion while the viscoelastic effect ensures adequate mass transport between interacting particles. The model includes a weighted transition between a Hertz-Mindlin type contact and the sintering model during heating of the discrete elements up to the sintering temperature. The model is verified by simulating pressureless sintering of zirconium diboride ceramic composites reinforced with multiple volume percentages of silicon carbide particulates. The model showed improvements in porosity, density and elastic modulus with increased particulate phase percentage up to 15 wt{\%}. The model showed enhanced densification at higher temperatures with good correlation with experimental data.},

@article{OSullivan2004,
abstract = {The distinct element method as proposed by Cundall and Strack uses the computationally efficient, explicit, central difference time integration scheme. A limitation of this scheme is that it is only conditionally stable, so small time steps must be used. Some researchers have proposed using an implicit time integration scheme to avoid the stability issues arising from the explicit time integrator typically used in these simulations. However, these schemes are computationally expensive and can require a significant number of iterations to form the stiffness matrix that is compatible with the contact state at the end of each time step. In this paper, a new, simple approach for calculating the critical time increment in explicit discrete element simulations is proposed. Using this approach, it is shown that the critical time increment is a function of the current contact conditions. Considering both two- and three-dimensional scenarios, the proposed refined estimates of the critical time step indicate that the earlier recommendations contained in the literature can be unconservative, in that they often overestimate the actual critical time step. A three-dimensional simulation of a problem with a known analytical solution illustrates the potential for erroneous results to be obtained from discrete element simulations, if the time-increment exceeds the critical time step for stable analysis.},

abstract = {Theoretical analysis and nowadays advanced numerical simulations for bedload particle transport widely share a popular assumption: All sediments are spherical and can be simplified as spheres, which apparently differs from reality. In order to explore the shape effects of sediment particles on their transport and to find out the possible consequence originated from the spherical assumption, a particle resolved computational model is established by combining the large eddy simulation for fluid and the discrete element method for the solid particles using an immersed boundary (IB) technique. Using this model, simulations are conducted for spherical and non-spherical bedload particles in both laminar and turbulent open channel flows. Simulation results show that shape of sediment particles has direct influence on the incipient motion in both laminar and turbulent flows. In laminar flows, the widely adopted spherical particles tend to exhibit over 5 times higher traveling speed compared with the non-spherical particles, and over 4 times longer time lag during incipient motion. In turbulent flows, the disk-shaped non-spherical particle yields up to 60{\%} higher travel speed, 50{\%} larger saltation height and 126{\%} longer saltation length compared with spherical particles. The travel modes of non-spherical sediment particles during incipient motion are also analyzed.},
