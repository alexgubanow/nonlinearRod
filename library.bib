abstract = {A planar rod model with flexible cross-section has been recently proposed in literature (Guinot et al., 2012). This model is especially suitable for the modeling of tape springs, which develop localized folds due to the flattening of the cross-section. Starting from a complete non-linear elastic shell model, original kinematics assumptions (inspired from the elastica model) have been made to describe the important in-plane changes of the cross-section shape. In the present work, the choice of the position of the rod reference line is discussed. This choice plays an important role in the overall behavior because of the large changes of the cross-section shape. We show that the model published in Guinot et al. (2012) can be improved by considering the centerline as the rod reference line. This enhanced model is then validated through quantitative comparisons with experimental results of dynamic deployments taken from literature. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Moulinec1998,
abstract = {The local and overall responses of nonlinear composites are classically investigated by the Finite Element Method. We propose an alternate method based on Fourier series which avoids meshing and which makes direct use of microstructure images. It is based on the exact expression of the Green function of a linear elastic and homogeneous comparison material. First, the case of elastic nonhomogeneous constituents is considered and an iterative procedure is proposed to solve the Lippman-Schwinger equation which naturally arises in the problem. Then, the method is extended to non-linear constituents by a step-by-step integration in time. The accuracy of the method is assessed by varying the spatial resolution of the microstructures. The flexibility of the method allows it to serve for a large variety of microstructures. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.},

@article{Fraternali2015,
abstract = {We study the geometrically nonlinear behavior of uniformly compressed tensegrity prisms through fully elastic and rigid-elastic models. The given models predict a variety of mechanical behaviors in the regime of large displacements, including an extreme stiffening-type response, already known in the literature, and a newly discovered, extreme softening behavior. The latter may lead to a snap buckling event producing an axial collapse of the structure. The switching from one mechanical regime to another depends on the aspect ratio of the structure, the magnitude of the applied prestress, and the material properties of the constituent elements. We discuss potential mechanical and acoustic applications of such behaviors, which are related to the design and manufacture of tensegrity lattices and innovative metamaterials.},

@article{Pimenta2003,
abstract = {This work presents a fully nonlinear geometrically-exact multi-parameter rod model that incorporates general in-plane cross-sectional changes as well as general out-of-plane cross- sectional warping. The formulation constitutes an extension of the earlier works, in the sense that the restrictions to a rigid cross-section and to a Saint-Venant-like elastic warping are now removed from the theory. The definition of energetically conjugated cross-sectional resultants in terms of generalized stresses and strains, based on the concept of a cross-section director, simplifies the derivation of equilibrium equations and the enforcement of boundary conditions, in either weak or strong senses. In addition, the corresponding tangent bilinear weak form is obtained in a more expedient way, rendering always symmetric for hyper-elastic materials and conservative loadings. The definition of a cross-section director allows also the introduction of independent degrees-of-freedom to describe both the in-plane cross-sectional changes and the out-of-plane warping. Fully three-dimensional finite strain constitutive equations can therefore be employed with no spurious stiffening. Finite rotations are treated consistently by the Euler-Rodrigues formula in a pure Lagrangean framework. Altogether, the present assumptions allow a consistent basis for the proper representation of profile (distortional) deformations, which are typical of cold-formed thin-walled rod structures. This is one of the main features of the formulation, as the use of more complex shell models in order to capture such phenomena can be needless.},

abstract = {In the framework of deployable structures, we focus on the modeling of tape springs, i.e. rod-like elastic bodies with thin-walled cross-section which develop localized folds due to a flattening of the cross-section. A rod model with highly deformable cross-section and few kinematics parameters is derived from a complete shell model, for large displacements, large rotations and dynamics. The simplicity of the model is achieved by introducing an elastica kinematics to describe the changes in the cross-section shape. This model is able to handle the formation of localized folds which can move along the rod line, merge or split, allowing to simulate complex scenarios of folding and deployment. {\textcopyright} 2012 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

@article{KuoMoHsiao1987,
abstract = {A very simple and effective formulation and numerical procedure to remove the restriction of small rotations between two successive increments for the geometrically nonlinear finite element analysis of in-plane frames is presented. A co-rotational formulation combined with small deflection beam theory with the inclusion of the effect of axial force is adopted. A body attached coordinate is used to distinguish between rigid body and deformational rotations. The deformational nodal rotational angles are assumed to be small, and the membrane strain along the deformed beam axis obtained from the elongation of the arc length of the deformed beam element is assumed to be constant. The element internal nodal forces are calculated using the total deformational nodal rotations in the body attached coordinate. The element stiffness matrix is obtained by superimposing the bending and the geometric stiffness matrices of the elementary beam element and the stiffness matrix of the linear bar element. An incremental iterative method based on the Newton-Raphson method combined with a constant arc length control method is employed for the solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations. In order to improve convergence properties of the equilibrium iteration, a two-cycle iteration scheme is introduced. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed method. {\textcopyright} 1987.},

@article{Buhl2000,
abstract = {The paper deals with topology optimiza- tion of structures undergoing large deformations. The geometrically nonlinear behaviour of the structures are modelled using a total Lagrangian finite element for- mulation and the equilibrium is found using a Newton- Raphson iterative scheme. The sensitivities of the ob- jective functions are found with the adjoint method and the optimization problem is solved using the Method of Moving Asymptotes. A filtering scheme is used to obtain checkerboard-free and mesh-independent designs and a continuation approach improves convergence to efficient designs. Different objective functions are tested. Minimizing compliance for a fixed load results in degenerated topol- ogies which are very inefficient for smaller or larger loads. The problem of obtaining degenerated “optimal” topol- ogies which only can support the design load is evenmore pronounced than for structures with linear response. The problem is circumvented by optimizing the structures for multiple loading conditions or by minimizing the com- plementary elastic work. Examples show that differences in stiffnesses of structures optimized using linear and nonlinear modelling are generally small but they can be large in certain cases involving buckling or snap-through effects},

@article{Guinot2012,
abstract = {This paper is focused on the modeling of rod-like elastic bodies that have an initially curved and thin-walled cross-section and that undergo important localized changes of the cross-section shape. The typical example is the folding of a carpenter's tape measure for which the folds are caused by the flattening of the cross-section in some localized areas. In this context, we propose a planar rod model that accounts for large displacements and large rotations in dynamics. Starting from a classical shell model, the main additional assumption consists in introducing an elastica kinematics to describe the large changes of the cross-section shape with very few parameters. The expressions of the strain and kinetic energies are derived by performing an analytical integration over the section. The Hamilton principle is directly introduced in a suitable finite element software to solve the problem. The folding, coiling and deployment of a tape spring is studied to demonstrate the ability of the model to account for several phenomena: creation of a single fold and associated snap-through behavior, splitting of a fold into two, motion of a fold along the tape during a dynamic deployment, scenarios of coiling and uncoiling of a bistable tape spring. This 1D model may also be relevant for future applications in biomechanics, biophysics and nanomechanics. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},
