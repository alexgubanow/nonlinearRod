Mechanic equivalent of fibrous tissue could be described as system of 1D rods.
Example of such flat 2D system are shown on figure \ref{fig:nodeExtract}.

System consists of discrete elements $e_1$, $e_2$ and $e_3$. All elements are
connected to each other through nodes $n_2$, $n_3$ and to special points through
$n_1$ and $n_4$. Each element $e_n$ of system has own orientation in global
coordinate system.

In case that node does not have external interrupt, like pressure or other
 applied force, schematic represent of node can be as on figure
 \ref{fig:nodeExtract}.\par

Mathematical model of discrete system is expressed by equations of nodes motion.
As elements is 1D, nodes will be 1D as well. All system acting in global
coordinate system $\{X, Y, Z\}$ and each element acting in own local coordinate
system $\{x,y,z\}$.
